### Goal Features

A tool that people can use to host various RPG campaigns, with a specific focus on a shared understanding of hex crawls / point crawls.

We'd have GMs with priviledged info, the ability to make markers, etc. 

We'd have Players with the ability to add shared notes.

We'd have a system for keeping track of resources and the like on a given node.


### Problems intentionally ignored

* Is it important that we represent enemy kingdoms?
